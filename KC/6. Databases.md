- [x] NoSQL databases have a flexible schema. ✅
- [ ] NoSQL databases use vertical scaling.
- [x] NoSQL databases use data models that are not based on relational tables ✅
- [ ] NoSQL databases can run transactional or analytical queries.

#### 4. Which of the following is not a type of anomaly?
- [ ] Deletion anomaly
- [ ] Insertion anomaly
- [ ] Update anomaly
- [x] Structure anomaly ✅

#### 5. What is the primary benefit of using database as a service (DBaaS)?

## KC - Data Interaction and Database Transaction

#### 1. A customer is ordering a product from an online retailer. If the payment for the transaction is successful, the Orders table must be updated so that a new order row is inserted. The stockTable table must also be updated so that product rows are removed for the purchased products. If one step fails, then all steps fail.

Which type of database transaction property does this scenario represent?
- [ ] Consistency
- [x] Atomicity ✅
- [ ] Durability
- [ ] Isolation

#### 2. The daily duties of database administrators include all of the following except which option?
- [x] Create different applications that can receive data ✅
- [ ] Use different SQL commands to interact with tables in databases
- [ ] Design, implement, administer, and monitor data in database systems
- [ ] Ensure consistency, quality, and security of the database

#### 3. What is a database transaction?
- [x] A transaction is the reproduction of one or more changes that are performed on a database. ✅
- [ ] A transaction is a web server running a webpage that gathers information from the server.
- [ ] A transaction is an application that is installed on the user computer or the application server.
- [ ] A transaction is an application written with Java that is used to embed SQL statements in the application code.

#### 4. What does the I in the term ACID compliance represent?
- [ ] The ability to ensure that any change will not violate the integrity of the database
- [ ] The ability to ensure that as soon as a transaction is committed, any interruption to database availability does not affect data consistency
- [x] The ability to concurrently process multiple transactions so that one transaction does not affect other transactions ✅
- [ ] The ability to ensure that all changes are successfully completed

#### 5. Which of the following options describes a successful transaction on a database?
- [x] A transaction on a database is successful if the transaction is committed. ✅
- [ ] A transaction on a database is successful if the transaction is active.
- [ ] A transaction on a database is successful if the transaction is partially committed.

- [ ] Rules and limitations are imposed by the database management system (DBMS).
- [x] Foreign key values must match an existing primary key value. ✅

- [ ] They control access to the data in a database.
- [ ] They create and modify the structure of a database.
- [x] They are used to view, add, change, or delete data in a table. ✅
